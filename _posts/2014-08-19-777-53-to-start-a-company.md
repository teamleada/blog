When I first began working on Leada, I remember scouring Quora posts, blogs, HackerNews, and various articles for information on how much it costs to start a startup. I thought details like the cost of company incorporation in California, the operating costs for a web application were part of your average startup’s laundry list of expenses and something that could be found on the internet; after all, mine was just one of hundreds of other startups trying to make it in the Bay Area, right?

Since Leada was recently accepted into an accelerator, we’ve begun transitioning our costs from a Google spreadsheet to a company bank account.  I thought I would chronicle our experience here as an example of the “out-of-pocket” expenses for a 3-person college-founded startup just getting off the ground. VC’s always say its dirt cheap to start a company, but how cheap is dirt cheap?

We realize that every company’s journey is different, and by sharing ours, we hope that you will find it informative. As a 23-year-old CEO, I feel about as competent as Walter White in the first season of Breaking Bad.  I don’t even know what I need to know.  I just know that there is much to learn.

The expenses (see image below for our “laundry list”) for us broke down into three categories: online tools, travel expenses, and everything else.
