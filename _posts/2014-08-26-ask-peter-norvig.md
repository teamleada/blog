When we first began Leada, we tried to better understand the data science industry by interviewing professionals in the field. As students simply wanting to learn more about data science, we ultimately created a free resource to inform both undergraduates and professionals about the data science industry. We accomplished this by having Q & A interviews with experts such as Mike Olsen, Hal Varian, and Tom Davenport and Data Scientists at LinkedIn, Facebook, Yelp, and more.


The Data Analytics Handbook was not only instrumental in giving us the understanding we needed to feel confident in what we were creating; but was downloaded over 25,000 times, gave us dozens of warm contacts, and an immediate group of early adopters. Some experts took longer to contact than others (I emailed Hal Varian over 8 times!) but you’d be surprised who you can get 25 minutes of time to help inform others. Read the handbook here.

As a conclusion to The Data Analytics Handbook, we thought it would be fun to see what questions our readers had about data science, and then had them answered by the #3 ranked most powerful data scientist in the world today by Forbes and Director of Research at Google, Peter Norvig.

A month ago, we allowed readers to submit questions about the data science industry and we took the top 8 most popular questions. Below are Peter’s responses, thanks to everyone who participated, Elizabeth Lin for designing the handbook, and a big thanks to Peter!
