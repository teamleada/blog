When we first began Leada, we tried to better understand the data science industry by interviewing professionals in the field. As students simply wanting to learn more about data science, we ultimately created a free resource to inform both undergraduates and professionals about the data science industry. We accomplished this by having Q & A interviews with experts such as Mike Olsen, Hal Varian, and Tom Davenport and Data Scientists at LinkedIn, Facebook, Yelp, and more.


The Data Analytics Handbook was not only instrumental in giving us the understanding we needed to feel confident in what we were creating; but was downloaded over 25,000 times, gave us dozens of warm contacts, and an immediate group of early adopters. Some experts took longer to contact than others (I emailed Hal Varian over 8 times!) but youâ€™d be surprised who you can get 25 minutes of time to help inform others. Read the handbook here.
