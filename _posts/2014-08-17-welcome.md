Welcome to the offical Leada Blog!

The genesis for Leada began in the Spring of 2014. As Statistics majors at UC Berkeley about to go into the world of industry, we faced a simple but alarming problem. We were quite familiar with the left, but in our jobs we were given the right.

More generally, we felt there was this knowledge gap between the skills that employers require and the theoretical education we were “empowered” with at our University. This problem isn’t just for Statistics majors, and it isn’t just for us at Cal.

But what if you could bring out the skills that employers require through projects that students could complete? Companies would be able to better qualify their candidates and students would gain experience completing industry-like work. It was a simple win-win situation that we were compelled to create. 

So what does a m.Eng. in Data Science dropout, a Computer Science & Statistics double major, and a Business & Statistics double major do but create this for data science? In the data science industry this becomes doubly powerful because of the 1.5 million talent gap that exists by 2018.* But is it really a talent gap? We believe data science is an interdisciplinary subject and can be tackled from a variety of backgrounds (Physics, Math, Economics, Business). We believe that the talent exists; the skill however, does not, and Leada will fix that. 

What is Leada? Leada is a recruiting platform for data science. We want to fill the gap in data science talent by creating industry data challenges for people who have the drive to become data scientists but lack the skills.
