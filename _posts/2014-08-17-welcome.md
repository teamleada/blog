The genesis for Leada began in the Spring of 2014. As Statistics majors at UC Berkeley going into industry, we faced an alarming problem. We were quite familiar with:

But in our jobs we were given the right:

This knowledge gap, between the skills that employers require and the theoretical education we were “empowered” with at our University, isn’t just a problem for Statistics majors, and it isn’t applicable just to Cal.

What if you could bring out the skills that employers require through projects that students could complete? Companies would be able to better qualify their candidates and students would gain experience completing industry-like work. It was a simple win-win situation that we were compelled to create.

So what does a m.Eng. in Data Science dropout, a Computer Science & Statistics double major, and a Business & Statistics double major do but create this for data science? An industry with a 1.75 million person talent gap by 2018.*

But is it really a talent gap? We believe data science is an interdisciplinary subject and can be tackled from a variety of backgrounds (Physics, Math, Economics, Business). We believe that the talent exists. The skill however, does not, and when individuals who have the talent but not the skill complete our challenges; we are filling the shortfall in data science hires.

What is Leada? Leada is a recruiting platform for data science. We want to fill the gap in data science talent by creating industry data challenges for people who have the drive to become data scientists but lack the skills.
