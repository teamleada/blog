The genesis for Leada began in the Spring of 2014. As recent graduates of UC Berkeley going into industry, we faced an alarming problem. We realized we were quite familiar with:

<br/>

But in our jobs, problems that required an understanding of the above were nowhere to be found. Instead
we were given:

</p>

<br/>

While in most cases we had the foundation to figure what we needed out, we didn't understand why there was such a large disparity between what you learn in school and actual work. This knowledge gap, between the skills that employers require and the theoretical education we were “empowered” with at our University, isn’t just a problem for Statistics majors, and it isn’t specific to Cal.

What if you could bring out the skills that employers require through projects that students could complete? Companies would be able to better qualify their candidates and students would gain experience completing industry-like work. It was a simple win-win situation that we were compelled to create.

So what does a m.Eng. in Data Science dropout, a Computer Science & Statistics double major, and a Business & Statistics double major do but create this for data science? An industry with a 1.75 million person talent gap by 2018.*

But is it really a <strong>talent</strong> gap? We believe data science is an interdisciplinary subject and can be tackled from a diverse set of backgrounds (Physics, Biology, Business, etc.). We believe that the talent exists. The skill, however, does not and when individuals who have the talent but not the skill complete our challenges; we are filling the shortfall in data science hires.

What is Leada? Leada is a recruiting platform for data science. We want to fill the gap in data science talent by creating industry data challenges for people who have the drive to become data scientists but lack the skills.
